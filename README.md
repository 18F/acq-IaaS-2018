# TTS Infrastructure as a Service

## Background

GSA TTS programs and client agencies of TTS operate on and require the use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS), due to its use as the infrastructure behind login.gov, cloud.gov, and Federalist. Client agencies in other parts of the Government that are using AWS IaaS as a result of such an arrangement include, but are not limited to, the Federal Election Commission, USDA Forest Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Office of Personnel Management, and GSA FAS.

GSA TTS use a number of different resources obtained through the AWS IaaS, many of which are required by the project’s underlying ATO and the project’s System Security Plan (SSP) upon which that ATO is approved.
